**** API.Response.Dynamic.Model ****

This solution builds dynamic data models.
The code analyzes the SQL query to be executed and the data model is built "on the fly".

The API then returns the result in JSON format

I implemented versioning in the API: It works for DB2/400, I am now adapting it for SQL SERVER.

The core remains unchanged however: it analyzes the result of the query.

Due to lack of time, I haven't had much for some time.

The possibilities offered by dynamic construction are numerous.

This solution is Open source, but feel free to leave me ideas for improvement.

Sorry for the core comments, I wrote in French :) !
